### Day 10: Integration & Scope Management (Wed, Nov 19)

**Topics Covered:**

**1. Monitor and Control Project Work** 🔥🔥🔥

- Ensuring stakeholders know project health
- Continuous monitoring throughout project lifecycle

**2. Data Analysis Techniques** 🔥🔥

- **Plurality** - Largest group (not necessarily majority)
- **Dictatorship** - One person decides
- **Multi-Criteria Decision-Making** - Multiple factors considered

**4. Perform Integrated Change Control** 🔥🔥🔥
- Highly tested process!

- In Agile: Product owner approves; significant changes escalate to sponsor
- All changes must go through formal approval

**5. Project Scope Management Introduction**
- **Product Scope** vs **Project Scope**
  - Product Scope = Features/functions of product
  - Project Scope = Work to deliver the product
- Six processes in Scope Management
- Critical for exam success

### Day 11: Scope Management Deep Dive (Thu, Nov 20)

**Topics Covered:**

**1. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** 🔥🔥🔥
- Hierarchical decomposition of project work
- Breaks project into smaller, manageable components
- Deliverable-oriented grouping
- **Key Rule:** WBS shows WHAT, not HOW
- Levels: Project → Deliverables → Work Packages
- **Work Package** = Lowest level of WBS

**2. Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)** 🔥🔥
- Critical document ensuring no requirements overlooked
- Links requirements from origin to deliverables
- Tracks requirements through entire project lifecycle
- Helps manage scope changes
- **Format:** Requirement ID | Description | Source | Status | Deliverable

**3. Project Scope Statement** 🔥🔥🔥
- Agreement between team and customer
- Defines what's included and excluded
- **Components:**
  - Project objectives
  - Product scope description
  - Project deliverables
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Project exclusions
  - Constraints
  - Assumptions

**4. WBS Dictionary** 🔥
- Detailed description of each work package
- Companion document to WBS
- **Contains:**
  - Work package ID
  - Description of work
  - Responsible organization
  - List of activities
  - Resources required
  - Cost estimates
  - Quality requirements

**5. Scope Baseline** 🔥🔥🔥
- **Combination of THREE documents:**
  1. WBS
  2. WBS Dictionary
  3. Project Scope Statement
- Used to measure scope performance
- Changes require formal change control

**6. Validate Scope** 🔥🔥
- Customer inspection and acceptance
- Formal acceptance of deliverables
- Done at end of phase or project
- **Different from Quality Control:**
  - Quality Control = Correctness (team checks)
  - Validate Scope = Acceptance (customer checks)

**7. Control Scope** 🔥
- Ensure delivered product matches planned scope
- Monitor scope status
- Manage scope changes
- Prevent scope creep
- Compare actual vs planned scope

---

### Day 12: Schedule Management (Mon, Nov 24)

**Topics Covered:**

**1. Schedule Management Plan** 🔥🔥
- Guides team on schedule definition, approval, and control
- Part of project management plan
- Defines:
  - How schedule will be developed
  - Level of accuracy
  - Units of measure
  - Control thresholds
  - Schedule baseline maintenance

**2. Define Activities**
- **Waterfall:** Activities defined for entire project upfront
- **Agile:** Activities defined per user story/iteration
- Continuous and iterative in Agile
- Creates Activity List

**3. Estimating Activity Durations** 🔥🔥🔥

**Waterfall Techniques:**

**A. Analogous Estimate (Top-Down)**
- Uses similar past projects
- Quick but less accurate
- Expert judgment based
- **Example:** Last website took 3 months, this one similar → estimate 3 months

**B. Parametric Estimate**
- Uses statistical relationship
- Mathematical model
- More accurate than analogous
- **Formula:** Duration = Quantity × Productivity Rate
- **Example:** 1000 lines of code × 10 lines/hour = 100 hours

**C. Three-Point Estimate** 🔥🔥🔥
- Uses three scenarios
- Most common in PMP exam!
- **Formulas:**

**Triangular Distribution:**
```
Estimate = (Optimistic + Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 3
```

**PERT/Beta Distribution (More Weight on Most Likely):**
```
Estimate = (Optimistic + 4×Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6
```

**Example:**
- Optimistic (O) = 10 days
- Most Likely (M) = 15 days
- Pessimistic (P) = 26 days

Triangular: (10 + 15 + 26) / 3 = 17 days
PERT: (10 + 4×15 + 26) / 6 = 16 days

**4. Agile Estimation Techniques** 🔥🔥

**A. Planning Poker**
- Delphi method application
- Team members estimate independently
- Reveal estimates simultaneously
- Discuss differences
- Reach consensus
- **Cards:** Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...)

**B. Affinity Estimation**
- Group similar items
- Relative sizing
- T-shirt sizes or story points
- Fast for large backlogs

**C. T-shirt Sizing**
- Categories: XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL
- Quick, relative estimation
- Good for early planning
- Later converted to story points

**5. Agile Schedule Metrics** 🔥🔥

**A. Lead Time**
- Time from request to delivery
- Customer perspective
- **Example:** Request on Monday, delivered Friday = 5 days lead time

**B. Cycle Time**
- Time from start of work to completion
- Team perspective
- **Example:** Started Wednesday, done Friday = 2 days cycle time

**C. Response Time**
- Time from request to start of work
- **Example:** Request Monday, start Wednesday = 2 days response time
- **Formula:** Lead Time = Response Time + Cycle Time

**D. Work in Progress (WIP) Limit** 🔥
- Maximum items in progress simultaneously
- Prevents overloading team
- Improves flow
- **Example:** WIP limit of 3 = max 3 tasks in "In Progress" column

**Important:** Agile focuses on flow-based metrics (lead time, cycle time, WIP) instead of burndown charts!

Estimate = (O + 4M + P) / 6
```

Where:
- O = Optimistic
- M = Most Likely
- P = Pessimistic

### Agile Time Metrics (Day 12)

```
Lead Time = Response Time + Cycle Time

Response Time = Time from request to start
Cycle Time = Time from start to completion
Lead Time = Time from request to delivery
```

### Previously Covered Formulas

**EVM (Day 5):**
```
CPI = EV / AC
SPI = EV / PV
EAC = BAC / CPI
ETC = EAC - AC
VAC = BAC - EAC
```

**Project Selection (Day 8):**
```
BCR = Benefits / Costs  (>1 = good)
